- Reach to other doing the challenge.
- Report my daily experience in a log on my github repository.

## My Strange Workflow

My current workflow is kind of messy and I will need to adress quickly some problemes it may cause to what I intent to do. I will briefly draft an explaination today and will correct the typos and other problemes as soon as possible tomorow or monday (we are saturday september 12 2020 18h10 EDT) I will clarify the situation so yyou can folow trough my repo and processes... Look at my temporary draft and open an issue if something is unclear or wait 2 or 3 days it should be already easier to understand...

### directory Structure

**Denotes the intent of having different project each day**
directorys `weeknumber/daynumber` are there to denode the intention of doing a different project each and every day... But as I may be working on past code in a previous day directory many things can happen in a same directory where as other daily directory can tend to be empty or lack documentation oif what has appened taht day...

### Branches

**Denotes the work for a future day of the challenge**
On branch for each remaining day is already created and waiting to be `Squash and Merge` within is already created pull request. the PR list is in reverse order you can see the [remaining pendin PR here](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/pulls)

### Tags

**Denotes the actual work that has occurede for that day of my challenge**

The Tag will keep the tip of an old branch alive after the branche is Squashed merged and deleted. Contrary to what I can do by working in different directorie
Tag are what remain after a dayu is completet where as branch is what exist before the day complete
[third-day-end.b](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/third-day-end.b) exist because after the [third-day-end](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/third-day-end) I added more content...

the `late` keyword e.g.: **seventh-day-end._late_** indicate a day closed after the due date. or the calendar date.

Short list of some tags:

- [first-day-end](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/first-day-end)
- [second-day-end](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/second-day-end)
- [third-day-end](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/third-day-end)
- [third-day-end.b](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/third-day-end.b)
- [fourth-day-end](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/fourth-day-end)
- [fifth-day-end.late](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/fifth-day-end.late)
- [sixth-day-end.late](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/sixth-day-end.late)
- [seventh-day-end.late](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tree/seventh-day-end.late)
  [Other Tags](https://github.com/Luxcium/100DaysOfCode/tags)

### Publication date

**The Tags will alway go chronologically and will not reflect missed day or accumulating delay**

Because some time I can be late the publicaiton day is the real calenday day and the tag day is the cronological day ordering no day **`X+1`** will occure prior to day **`X`** and no day **`X`** will occure prior day **`X-1`** to know

The directorys have a structure that was changed from the **[first week](/first-week):** [`day-one`](/first-week/day-one)
[`day-two`](/first-week/day-two) [`day-three`](/first-week/day-three) [`day-four`](/first-week/day-four) to the **[second week](/second-week):** [`fift-day`](/second-week/fift-day) [`sixth-day`](/second-week/sixth-day) [`seveth-day`](/second-week/seveth-day) [`eighth-day`](/second-week/eighth-day) and so on ...
